/**
 * First implementation for the base of a remotely controlled background service for 0MQ.
 *
 * <p>
 * A side or endpoint designates the same thing: the thread where lives one of the two parts of the system.
 * <br/>
 * A {@link ZStar Star} has 2 sides (with a trial to use theater terms for fun (: and hopefully clarity :)
 * <br/>
 * - the Corbeille side, or control side
 * <br/>
 * This is where one can {@link ZAgent#send(ZMsg) send} and {@link ZAgent#recv() receive} control messages to the underneath star via the ZStar agent.
 * <br/>
 * The ZStar lives on this side and is a way to safely communicate with the distant provided star.
 * <br/>
 * Note: Corbeille is a french word designing the most privileged places in the theater where the King was standing,
 * 1st floor, just above the orchestra (Wikipedia...).
 *
 * <p>
 * - the Plateau side, or background side where all the performances are made by the provided star.
 * <br/>
 * The provided star is living on the Plateau.
 * <br/>
 * The Plateau is made of the Stage where effective acting takes place and of the Wings
 * where the provided star can perform control decisions to stop or continue the acting.
 * <br/>
 * From this side, the work is done via callbacks using the template-method pattern, applied with interfaces (?)
 * <p>
 * Communication between the 2 sides is ensured by {@link #pipe() pipes} that <b>SHALL NEVER</b> be mixed between background and control sides.
 * <br/>
 * Instead, each side use its own pipe to communicate with the other one, transmitting only 0MQ messages.
 * The main purpose of this class is to ease this separation and to provide contracts, responsibilities and action levers for each side.
 * <br/>
 * For example, instead of using pipe() which is useful to have more control, fast users would want to call {@link #agent()} to get the agent
 * or directly call {@link #send(ZMsg)} or {@link #recv()} from the ZStar as the ZStar is itself an agent!
 * <p>
 * The ZStar takes care of the establishment of the background processing, calling the provided star
 * at appropriate times. It can also manage the {@link ZAgent#sign() exited} state on the control side,
 * if providing a non-null "Mot de la Fin".
 * <br/>
 * It also takes care of the closing of sockets and context if it had to create one.
 * <p>
 * A {@link Star star} is basically a contract interface that anyone who uses this ZStar to create a background service SHALL comply to.<br/>
 * <p>
 * PS: Je sais qu'il y a une différence entre acteur et comédien :)
 * PPS: I know nothing about theater!
 * <p>
 * For an example of code, please refer to the {@link ZActor} source code.
