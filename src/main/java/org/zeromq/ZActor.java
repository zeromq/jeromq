/**
 * First implementation of a background actor remotely controlled for 0MQ.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is based on the {@link ZStar} one (TODO via inheritance now but this is not totally stamped and the use of the ZAgent would probably limit the collateral damages if changed)
 * so you should be first familiar with the metaphor there.
 * <br>
 * To extensively sum up:
 * <p>
 * A side or endpoint designates the same thing: the thread where lives one of the two parts of the Actor system.
 * <br/>
 * An actor has 2 sides (with a trial to use theater terms for fun (: and hopefully clarity :)
 * <br/>
 * - the Corbeille side, or control side
 * <br/>
 * This is where one can {@link #send(ZMsg) send} and {@link #recv() receive} control messages to the underneath actor via the ZActor and/or its agent.
 * <br/>
 * The ZActor lives on this side and is a way to safely communicate with the distant provided Actor
 * <br/>
 * Note: Corbeille is a french word designing the most privileged seats in the theater,
 * 1st floor, just above the orchestra (Wikipedia...).
 * It was the place where the King was standing during the shows, with the best seat of course!
 *
 * Fast users who would want to communicate with the distant {@link Actor} can use
 * {@link #send(ZMsg)} or {@link #recv()} from the ZActor as the ZActor is itself an agent!
 * <p>
 * - the Plateau side, or background side where all the performances are made by the provided actor.
 * <br/>
 * The provided {@link Actor} is living on the Plateau.
 * <br/>
 * The Plateau is made of the Stage where {@link org.zeromq.ZActor.Actor#stage(org.zeromq.ZMQ.Socket, org.zeromq.ZMQ.Socket, org.zeromq.ZPoller, int) the effective processing occurs} and of the Backstage
 * where the provided actor can {@link org.zeromq.ZActor.Actor#backstage(org.zeromq.ZMQ.Socket, org.zeromq.ZPoller, int) send and receive} control messages to and from the ZActor.
 * <br/>
 * From this side, the work is done via callbacks using the template-method pattern, applied with interfaces (?)
 * <p>
 *
 * The main purpose (or at least its intent) of this class is to clarify the contracts, roles, responsibilities and action levers related to the Plateau.
 * <p>
 * The provided Actor will not be alone to do the processing of each loop.
 * <br/>
 * It will be helped by a double responsible for passing the appropriate structures at the right moment.
 * As a developer point of view, this double helps also to limit the complexity of the process.
 * However Double is an uncommon one, capturing all the lights while letting the Actor taking care of all the invisible work in the shadows.
 * And this is one of the points where we begin to reach the limits of the metaphor...
 * <p>
 * The ZActor takes care of the establishment of the background processing, calling the provided Actor
 * at appropriate times via its Double. It can also manage the {@link #sign() exited} state on the control side,
 * if using the provided {@link #send(ZMsg)} or {@link #recv()} methods.
 * <br/>
 * It also takes care of the automatic closing of sockets and context if it had to create one.
 * <p>
 * An {@link Actor actor} is basically a contract interface that anyone who uses this ZActor SHALL comply to.<br/>
 * TODO This interface is still a little bit tough, as instead of the 5+2 Star callbacks, here are 10!
 * But they allow you to have a hand on the key points of the looping, restart a new actor if needed, ...
 * Anyway, adapters like a {@link SimpleActor simple one} or a {@link Duo duo} are present to help you on that, reducing the amount of
 * methods to write.
 * <p>
 * PS: Je sais qu'il y a une différence entre acteur et comédien :)
 * PPS: I know nothing about theater!
 * <p>
 * Example of code for a minimalistic actor with no socket handling other than the control pipe:
 *
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
