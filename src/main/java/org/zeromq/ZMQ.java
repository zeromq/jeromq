/**
 * <p>The ØMQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends the standard socket interfaces
 * with features traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products.
 * ØMQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns,
 * message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport protocols and more.</p>
 *
 * <p>Following is an overview of ØMQ concepts, describes how ØMQ abstracts standard sockets
 * and provides a reference manual for the functions provided by the ØMQ library.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Contexts</h2>
 * <p>Before using any ØMQ library functions you must create a {@link ZMQ.Context ØMQ context} using {@link ZMQ#context(int)}.
 * When you exit your application you must destroy the context using {@link ZMQ.Context#close()}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 * A ØMQ context is thread safe and may be shared among as many application threads as necessary,
 * without any additional locking required on the part of the caller.
 * <br>
 * Individual ØMQ sockets are not thread safe except in the case
 * where full memory barriers are issued when migrating a socket from one thread to another.
 * <br>
 * In practice this means applications can create a socket in one thread with * {@link ZMQ.Context#socket(SocketType)}
 * and then pass it to a newly created thread as part of thread initialization.
 *
 * <h3>Multiple contexts</h3>
 * Multiple contexts may coexist within a single application.
 * <br>
 * Thus, an application can use ØMQ directly and at the same time make use of any number of additional libraries
 * or components which themselves make use of ØMQ as long as the above guidelines regarding thread safety are adhered to.
 *
 * <h2>Messages</h2>
 * A ØMQ message is a discrete unit of data passed between applications or components of the same application.
 * ØMQ messages have no internal structure and from the point of view of ØMQ itself
 * they are considered to be opaque binary data.
 *
 * <h2>Sockets</h2>
 * {@link ZMQ.Socket ØMQ sockets} present an abstraction of a asynchronous message queue,
 * with the exact queueing semantics depending on the socket type in use.
 *
 * <h2>Transports</h2>
 * <p>A ØMQ socket can use multiple different underlying transport mechanisms.
 * Each transport mechanism is suited to a particular purpose and has its own advantages and drawbacks.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following transport mechanisms are provided:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Unicast transport using TCP</li>
 * <li>Local inter-process communication transport</li>
 * <li>Local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Proxies</h2>
 * <p>ØMQ provides proxies to create fanout and fan-in topologies.
 * A proxy connects a frontend socket to a backend socket
 * and switches all messages between the two sockets, opaquely.
 * A proxy may optionally capture all traffic to a third socket.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Security</h2>
 * <p>A ØMQ socket can select a security mechanism. Both peers must use the same security mechanism.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following security mechanisms are provided for IPC and TCP connections:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Null security</li>
 * <li>Plain-text authentication using username and password</li>
 * <li>Elliptic curve authentication and encryption</li>
 * </ul>

     * Abstracts an asynchronous message queue, with the exact queuing semantics depending on the socket type in use.
     * <br>
     * Where conventional sockets transfer streams of bytes or discrete datagrams, ØMQ sockets transfer discrete messages.
     * <h2>Key differences to conventional sockets</h2>
     * Generally speaking, conventional sockets present a synchronous interface to either
     * connection-oriented reliable byte streams (SOCK_STREAM),
     * or connection-less unreliable datagrams (SOCK_DGRAM).
     * <br>
     * In comparison, ØMQ sockets present an abstraction of an asynchronous message queue,
     * with the exact queueing semantics depending on the socket type in use.
     * Where conventional sockets transfer streams of bytes or discrete datagrams, ØMQ sockets transfer discrete messages.
     * <br>
     * ØMQ sockets being asynchronous means that the timings of the physical connection setup and tear down, reconnect and effective delivery
     * are transparent to the user and organized by ØMQ itself.
     * Further, messages may be queued in the event that a peer is unavailable to receive them.
     * <br>
     * Conventional sockets allow only strict one-to-one (two peers), many-to-one (many clients, one server), or in some cases one-to-many (multicast) relationships.
     * With the exception of {@link ZMQ#PAIR}, ØMQ sockets may be connected to multiple endpoints using {@link ZMQ.Socket#connect(String)},
     * while simultaneously accepting incoming connections from multiple endpoints bound to the socket using {@link ZMQ.Socket#bind(String)},
     * thus allowing many-to-many relationships.
     * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
     * ØMQ sockets are not thread safe. <strong>Applications MUST NOT use a socket from multiple threads</strong>
     * except after migrating a socket from one thread to another with a "full fence" memory barrier.
     * <br>
     * ØMQ sockets are not Thread.interrupt safe. <strong>Applications MUST NOT interrupt threads using ØMQ sockets</strong>.
     * <h2>Messaging patterns</h2>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Request-reply
     * <br>
     * The request-reply pattern is used for sending requests from a {@link ZMQ#REQ} client to one or more {@link ZMQ#REP} services, and receiving subsequent replies to each request sent.
     * The request-reply pattern is formally defined by http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:28.
     * {@link ZMQ#REQ}, {@link ZMQ#REP}, {@link ZMQ#DEALER}, {@link ZMQ#ROUTER} socket types belong to this pattern.
     * </li>
     * <li>Publish-subscribe
     * <br>
     * The publish-subscribe pattern is used for one-to-many distribution of data from a single publisher to multiple subscribers in a fan out fashion.
     * The publish-subscribe pattern is formally defined by http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:29.
     * {@link ZMQ#SUB}, {@link ZMQ#PUB}, {@link ZMQ#XSUB}, {@link ZMQ#XPUB} socket types belong to this pattern.
     * </li>
     * <li>Pipeline
     * <br>
     * The pipeline pattern is used for distributing data to nodes arranged in a pipeline. Data always flows down the pipeline, and each stage of the pipeline is connected to at least one node.
     * When a pipeline stage is connected to multiple nodes data is round-robined among all connected nodes.
     * The pipeline pattern is formally defined by http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:30.
     * {@link ZMQ#PUSH}, {@link ZMQ#PULL} socket types belong to this pattern.
     * </li>
     * <li>Exclusive pair
     * <br>
     * The exclusive pair pattern is used to connect a peer to precisely one other peer. This pattern is used for inter-thread communication across the inproc transport,
     * using {@link ZMQ#PAIR} socket type.
     * The exclusive pair pattern is formally defined by http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:31.
     * </li>
     * <li>Native
     * <br>
     * The native pattern is used for communicating with TCP peers and allows asynchronous requests and replies in either direction,
     * using {@link ZMQ#STREAM} socket type.
     * </li>

    /**
     * Class that interfaces the generation of CURVE key pairs.
     *
     * <p>The CURVE mechanism defines a mechanism for secure authentication and confidentiality for communications between a client and a server.
     * CURVE is intended for use on public networks.
     * The CURVE mechanism is defined by this document: http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:25.</p>
     *
     * <h2>Client and server roles</h2>
     *
     * <p>A socket using CURVE can be either client or server, at any moment, but not both. The role is independent of bind/connect direction.
     * A socket can change roles at any point by setting new options. The role affects all connect and bind calls that follow it.</p>
     *
     * <p>To become a CURVE server, the application sets the {@link ZMQ.Socket#setAsServerCurve(boolean)} option on the socket,
     * and then sets the {@link ZMQ.Socket#setCurveSecretKey(byte[])} option to provide the socket with its long-term secret key.
     * The application does not provide the socket with its long-term public key, which is used only by clients.</p>
     *
     * <p>To become a CURVE client, the application sets the {@link ZMQ.Socket#setCurveServerKey(byte[])} option
     * with the long-term public key of the server it intends to connect to, or accept connections from, next.
     * The application then sets the {@link ZMQ.Socket#setCurvePublicKey(byte[])} and {@link ZMQ.Socket#setCurveSecretKey(byte[])} options with its client long-term key pair.
     * If the server does authentication it will be based on the client's long term public key.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Key encoding</h3>
     *
     * <p>The standard representation for keys in source code is either 32 bytes of base 256 (binary) data,
     * or 40 characters of base 85 data encoded using the Z85 algorithm defined by http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:32.
     * The Z85 algorithm is designed to produce printable key strings for use in configuration files, the command line, and code.
     * There is a reference implementation in C at https://github.com/zeromq/rfc/tree/master/src.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Test key values</h3>
     *
     * <p>For test cases, the client shall use this long-term key pair (specified as hexadecimal and in Z85):</p>
     * <ul>

     * <p>BB88471D65E2659B30C55A5321CEBB5AAB2B70A398645C26DCA2B2FCB43FC518</p>
