     * The channel pattern is the thread-safe version of the exclusive pair pattern.
     * The channel pattern is used to connect a peer to precisely one other peer.
     * This pattern is used for inter-thread communication across the inproc transport.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A socket of type 'CHANNEL' can only be connected to a single peer at any one
     * time.  No message routing or filtering is performed on messages sent over a
     * 'CHANNEL' socket.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When a 'CHANNEL' socket enters the 'mute' state due to having reached the
     * high water mark for the connected peer, or, for connection-oriented transports,
     * if the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there is no connected peer, then
     * any {@link org.zeromq.ZMQ.Socket#send(byte[], int)} operations on the socket shall block until the peer
     * becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * While 'CHANNEL' sockets can be used over transports other than 'inproc',
     * their inability to auto-reconnect coupled with the fact new incoming connections will
     * be terminated while any previous connections (including ones in a closing state)
     * exist makes them unsuitable for TCP in most cases.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * NOTE: 'CHANNEL' sockets are designed for inter-thread communication across
     * the 'inproc' transport and do not implement functionality such
     * as auto-reconnection.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * NOTE: 'CHANNEL' sockets are threadsafe. They do not accept ZMQ_RCVMORE on receives.
     * This limits them to single part data.
